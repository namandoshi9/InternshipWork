1) __init__()
-> __init__ method in Python is used to initialize objects of a class. It is also called a constructor.

-> memory allocation for object (optional)



3) __str__()
-> The __str__() method returns a human-readable, or informal, string representation of an object.
-> This method is called by the built-in print() , str() , and format() functions.
-> If you don't define a __str__() method for a class, then the built-in object implementation calls the __repr__() method instead.(representation)



4) pass
-> Use the pass keyword when you do not want to add any other properties or methods to the class. 



5) super()
-> super() function that will make the child class inherit all the methods and properties from its parent.
-> By using the super() function, you do not have to use the name of the parent element, it will automatically inherit the methods and properties from its parent.
