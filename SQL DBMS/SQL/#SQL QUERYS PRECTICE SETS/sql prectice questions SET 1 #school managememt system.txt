   - Retrieve the names of teachers who teach a specific subject, sorted by their last name.
   - Retrieve the classes scheduled on a particular day of the week.

6. **Aggregate Functions:**
   - Calculate the average grade of a specific student across all classes.
   - Determine the highest and lowest grades in a particular class.
   - Calculate the total number of students enrolled in the school.

7. **Grouping Data:**
   - Group students by their grade level and count the number of students in each grade.
   - Group teachers by the subject they teach and list the number of teachers for each subject.

8. **Joins:**
   - Retrieve the names of students along with the classes they are enrolled in.
   - Retrieve the names of teachers along with the classes they teach.
   - Retrieve the grades of students along with the corresponding class names.

9. **Subqueries:**
   - Find students who have grades above the average grade of their class.
   - List classes with more than 20 students enrolled.

10. **Updating and Deleting Data:**
    - Update the contact information of a specific student.
    - Delete a student from the database along with their grades.
    - Delete a class from the database along with its schedule.

1. **Create a Database:**
   - Write a SQL query to create a new database named "ExerciseDB".

2. **Create Tables:**

     - StudentID (int, primary key)
     - FirstName (varchar)
     - LastName (varchar)
     - Age (int)
     - Grade (varchar)

3. **Insert Data:**
   - Insert at least 5 records into the "Students" table with sample data for each column.

   - Write a SQL query to display all the records in the "Students" table.

5. **Update Data:**
   - Update the record of the student with StudentID = 3 to change their Grade to "B".

6. **Delete Data:**
   - Delete the record of the student with StudentID = 5 from the "Students" table.
